## Hi there, I’m **Edgar**!  
I’m an **AI Engineer** focused on bridging the gap between traditional APIs and the exciting possibilities of AI. With over **10 years** of experience working on API design, SQL/NoSQL data flows, GraphQL schemas, and complex **platform migrations**, I’m passionate about **transforming static APIs into AI-ready solutions**.

### **What I’m Working On**  
- **API → AI Migration**: Building tools and frameworks that seamlessly convert legacy APIs into AI-compatible endpoints, simplifying integration with NLP models and advanced AI ecosystems.  
- **Natural Language Processing**: Harnessing libraries like **Hugging Face Transformers** to empower next-gen AI applications—enabling more intuitive, context-aware interactions with APIs.  
- **Data-Driven Architectures**: Designing **robust database schemas** and caching strategies to ensure reliable, high-performance data flow in modern AI pipelines.

### **My Background**  
- **10+ Years in API Engineering**: Extensive experience with REST, SOAP, GraphQL, and real-time event-driven architectures.  
- **Cross-Platform Migrations**: Successfully led multiple projects migrating on-premise systems to cloud-based solutions, optimizing performance and maintainability.  
- **SQL & Data Handling**: Well-versed in SQL and NoSQL data models, ensuring data integrity and scaling solutions to meet enterprise-level demands.

### **Why AI?**  
The future of API integrations lies in **intelligent, adaptive** systems that can understand context and respond dynamically. I’m on a mission to make **“API 2 AI”** transformations more accessible, accelerating how businesses adopt **cognitive services, NLP, and advanced machine learning** techniques.
